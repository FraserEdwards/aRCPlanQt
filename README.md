aRCPlan

aRCplan is c++ implementation of engineering model used to analyse rapid crack propagation RCP in plastic pipes. RCP is a potentially catastrophic mode of failure characterised by a rapidly progressing crack as the result of a sudden impact upon a gas or water pressureised pipeline. 

This program carries out the model published by Dr Patrick Leevers in "An engineering model for rapid crack propagation along fluid pressurised plastic pipe". External to the central model, the program provides an interface and range of inputs and outputs.
